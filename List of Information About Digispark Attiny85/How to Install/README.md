# Using Digispark ATtiny85 as a Keyboard in Arduino IDE

To use the Digispark ATtiny85 as a keyboard in the Arduino IDE, you'll need to install the Digistump's Digispark board package. Here's a step-by-step guide to set it up:

## Install the Arduino IDE

If you haven't already, download and install the latest version of the Arduino IDE from the official website: [Arduino Software](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)

## Install the Digispark Board Package

To add Digispark support to the Arduino IDE, you'll need to install the Digistump's board package. Follow these steps:

1. Open the Arduino IDE.
2. Go to "File" > "Preferences."
3. In the "Additional Boards Manager URLs" field, paste the following URL: http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json


4. Click "OK" to close the Preferences window.
5. Next, navigate to "Tools" > "Board" > "Boards Manager."
6. Search for "Digistump AVR Boards" in the Boards Manager search bar.
7. Click on "Digistump AVR Boards" and click the "Install" button.
8. Once the installation is complete, close the Boards Manager.

## Select Digispark Board

Now that the Digispark board package is installed, you can select the Digispark board in the Arduino IDE:

1. Connect your Digispark ATtiny85 board to your computer using a USB cable.
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to "Tools" > "Board" and select "Digispark (Default - 16.5 MHz)."

## Write the Keyboard Code

You can use the code I provided earlier for the keyboard functionality. Simply copy the code and paste it into a new Arduino sketch.

## Upload the Code to Digispark

Before uploading, you'll need to make a small adjustment to the code. Replace `#include "DigiKeyboard.h"` with `#include "DigiKeyboardDigi.h"`. This change is required for Digispark boards.

1. Click on the "Upload" button in the Arduino IDE to compile and upload the code to your Digispark board.

## Use the Arduino GUI

After uploading the code to the Digispark, it will work as a custom keyboard. You can open any text editor or word processor and see the keyboard input generated by the Digispark.

Remember that the Digispark has limited memory and capabilities, so complex keyboard functionalities may require more optimization or might not be feasible on this tiny microcontroller.
